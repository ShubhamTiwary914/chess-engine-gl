#GoBit
**A Chess program in Go**

This is from a Youtube serie that explains the steps in building a fairly strong chess engine. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQEf3a1WvsgWTjzqNMkRjA/featured?view_as=public

The Program will be featuring state of the art search techniques and is based on bitboards. Eventually magic numbers for bitBoards will be used for move generation.

The Go-code from the video clip will be tagged here in Git. Sometimes in groups.
